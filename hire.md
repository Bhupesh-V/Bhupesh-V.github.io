If you want to work with me on any paid contract/freelance gigs, I usually work in 2 different but connected domains.
I am also open for any full-time roles at the moment.

## As a Software Developer/Programmer/Engineer

I work with following technologies:

- Go (GraphQL, REST, CLIs)
- Python (Django, Flask, APIs, CLIs)
- Flutter (Desktop and Android)
- Bash/Shell scripting
- Vanilla JS

## As a Technical Writer

If you have a developer-facing product I can help you figure out your documentation, blogs etc.

### Things I avoid writing about

- Computer Graphics, Game dev
- Web3
- AI & ML

### Things I usually write about (open-ended)

- Developer Productivity
- DevOps/DevTooling
- CLIs
- Open-Source
- Side-projects
