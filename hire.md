<br>

If you want to work with me on any paid contract/freelance gigs, I usually work in 3 different but connected domains.

## `Domain A`: As a Software Dev

I work with following tools and technologies in this domain:

- Go (Microservices, GraphQL, gRPC, JSON Web APIs).
- Python (Django, Flask, APIs).
- Bash/Shell Scripting, CLIs, the Unix ecosystem.

## `Domain B`: As a Technical Writer

As a freelance tech writer (mostly ghostwriting), I’ve completed 30+ successful projects for multiple clients. If you have a developer-facing product, I can help you figure out your documentation, blogs, marketing tactics etc.

### Things I usually write about (open-ended)

- Developer Productivity
- DevOps/DevTooling
- Open-Source
- Side-projects

I also maintain a mega list of [my own favorite pieces of writing](/writing/).

## `Domain C`: As a Dev Community Builder/Manager

I have been managing India's largest forum-based dev network, [r/developersIndia](https://reddit.com/r/developersIndia) since its inception in 2020 (5 years & counting). Through this experience, I have gained valuable insights into the developer ecosystem. I can help you with:

- Building & managing dev communities.
- Understanding the developer ecosystem.
- Developer marketing strategies.
