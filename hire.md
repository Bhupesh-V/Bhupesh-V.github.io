I work with following tools and technologies in this domain:

- Go (Microservices, GraphQL, gRPC, REST).
- Python (Django, Flask, APIs).
- Bash/Shell Scripting, CLIs, the Unix ecosystem.

If you have a developer-facing product I can help you figure out your documentation, blogs, marketing tactics etc.
