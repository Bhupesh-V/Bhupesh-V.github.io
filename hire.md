If you want to work with me on any paid contract/freelance gigs, I usually work in 2 different but connected domains.

> I am also open for any full-time roles at the moment.

I work with following technologies:

- Go (Microservices, GraphQL, gRPC, REST, CLIs)
- Python (Django, Flask, APIs, CLIs)
- Flutter (Desktop and Android)
- Bash/Shell Scripting

## As a Technical Writer

If you have a developer-facing product I can help you figure out your documentation, blogs etc.

### Things I avoid writing about
