I help you interview me better. Here's a list of questions with answers saving you the time to know me better or analyse my work.

### What do you consider as your greatest achievement so far?

### What makes you who are you today?

### Tell us about a really difficult technical problem you solved. What was it and what did you build?

### What's the best thing you've made without anybody asking?

[**ugit**](https://github.com/bhupesh-v/ugit), well not exactly people indeed asked for it. Till date its probably the most popular project I have made.

### What's the first thing you built? When and why did you build it?

I think the first every actual software I made was [**tutorialdb**](https://github.com/bhupesh-v/tutorialdb) in 2017. Back then I described it as a search engine for programming tutorials. The main motivation behind this to stop asking questions like "Can you share resources to learn ABC".
Now that I look back at it, it wasn't a full-fledged search engine but more of a glorified link aggregator.

However it did have indexing like capabilities, given a webpage URL it could detect whether it was a tutorial or not. It was built using Python and SQLite.

### What's a popular opinion that you agree with?

### What great software is nobody building?
