<!-- ### What do you consider as your greatest achievement so far? -->

### What makes you who are you today?

Reading & Writing, atleast from a career POV. Both have had a huge impact on how I think and approach problems. I have been reading since I was a kid, mostly fiction and non-fiction. I started writing in 2017, mostly technical stuff.

> Two must read books I can recommend is [Wings of Fire]() and [48 Creative Meditations That Will Enrich Your Life]()

### Tell us about a really difficult technical problem you solved. What was it and what did you build?

Really? I don't remember at all.

### What's the best thing you've made without anybody asking?

[**ugit**](https://github.com/bhupesh-v/ugit), well not exactly people indeed asked for it. Till date its probably the most popular project I have made.

### What's the first thing you built? When and why did you build it?

I think the first every actual software I made was [**tutorialdb**](https://github.com/bhupesh-v/tutorialdb) in 2017. Back then I described it as a search engine for programming tutorials. The main motivation behind this to stop asking questions like "Can you share resources to learn ABC".
Now that I look back at it, it wasn't a full-fledged search engine but more of a glorified link aggregator.

However it did have indexing like capabilities, given a webpage URL it could detect whether it was a tutorial or not. It was built using Python and SQLite.

> To be fair, the first thing I ever built was a simple calculator using Visual Basic 6.0 during my school days.


### What great software is nobody building?

Honestly, I think we have built everything we need.

### Can you build scalable systems?

No. Let's talk about scalability once the product you work for is growing through an exponential growth.

### Do you prefer working on coding projects alone or with a team?

Both, both is good. I need alone time to be productive solo and I need a team to get things done faster. I am very much open to brainstorming sessions, pair programming, etc.

### What sets you apart from other applicants for `ABC` position?

Nothing, honestly. I consider myself as an average dev. I am not going to sit here gloat about things that can change your perspective. A lot public stuff that I have, like my [blog](https://bhupesh.me/), [digital garden](https://til.bhupesh.me/), [github](https://github.com/bhupesh-V/) justifies my skills and knowledge. If you disagree, you are free to reject. At the end of the day, hiring humans is basically a trust exercise.

### What are you working on right now?

This is documented on my [now page](https://bhupesh.me/now/).
