## Disclaimers

- This document is only meant to be read by folks who take the final decision in hiring me. i.e, Senior/Staff Devs, EMs, CTOs, Founders, etc. It would be great if you read this very early in the hiring process.
- This is a live document, if this was shared to you by me, assume it's the latest version.
- For everyone else on the internet, feel free to steal questions but avoid copying my answers. Interviewers are not dumb, they will know whether you are putting your money where your mouth is or not.
- If the interviewer isn't aware about this document, you can very well assume that I am going to read answers from this document. So, it's better to ask questions that are not listed here.

### What makes you who you are today?

Reading & Writing, atleast from a career POV. Both have had a huge impact on how I think and approach problems. I have been reading since I was a kid, mostly fiction and non-fiction. I started writing in 2017, mostly technical stuff.

> Two must read books I can recommend is [Wings of Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wings_of_Fire_(autobiography)) and [48 Creative Meditations That Will Enrich Your Life](https://archive.org/details/mindthatchangese0000gawl)

### Tell us about a really difficult technical problem you solved. What was it and what did you build?

Really? I don't remember at all.

### What's the best thing you've made without anybody asking?

[**ugit**](https://github.com/bhupesh-v/ugit), well not exactly people indeed asked for it. Till date its probably the most popular project I have made.

### What's the first thing you built? When & Why did you build it?

I think the first every actual software I made was [**tutorialdb**](https://github.com/bhupesh-v/tutorialdb) in 2017. Back then I described it as a search engine for programming tutorials. The main motivation behind this to stop asking questions like "Can you share resources to learn ABC".
Now that I look back at it, it wasn't a full-fledged search engine but more of a glorified link aggregator.

However it did have indexing like capabilities, given a webpage URL it could detect whether it was a tutorial or not. It was built using Python and SQLite.

> To be fair, the first thing I ever built was a simple calculator using Visual Basic 6.0 during my school days.

### What great software is nobody building?

Honestly, I think we have built everything we need.

### Can you build scalable systems?

No. Let's talk about scalability once the product you work for is going through an exponential growth. However, I am eager to build _stable_ systems. You know the ones that don't crash when a user uploads a 10MB image or when a user tries to login with a password that is 1000 characters long.

### Do you prefer working on coding projects alone or with a team?

Both, both is good. I need alone time to be productive solo and I need a team to get things done faster. I am very much open to brainstorming sessions, pair programming, etc.

### What sets you apart from other applicants for `ABC` position?

Nothing, honestly. I consider myself as an average human with average skills. I am not going to sit here gloat about things that can change your perspective. A lot public stuff that I have, like my [blog](https://bhupesh.me/), [digital garden](https://til.bhupesh.me/), [github](https://github.com/bhupesh-V/) justifies my skills & knowledge. If you disagree, you are free to reject. At the end of the day, hiring humans is basically a trust exercise.

<!-- ### Talk to me, in a free form back & forth way about software development -->

<!-- ### What are some things you have yet to learn?

Everything? Lol, Joke apart, I would very much love to work with a team that:

1. Take software security seriously.
2.  -->


### Do you know how to use `INSERT_DEVTOOL`?

Probably not, I use tools to the extent it helps me get the job done. As much us devs cherish our devtools, I believe that we create problems for ourselves with each new tool we add to our stack. 

If the tool, you are talking about is something that is absolutely necessary for the job (like shit will went down if this tool didn't exist), you can assume that I will learn to use it or adapt to it to a point where we can discuss about it.

### Do you know about `INSERT_PRACTICE` or `INSERT_PRINCIPLE`?

I might have heard about it, but I am not sure. I am not a big fan of practices or principles, However I am always reading so expect a generic answer about the practice or principle. My work gets influenced by an amalgamation of real world experiences:

- My failed attempts at introducing something new I learned.
- Attempts at practices the team collectively decides.
- Tools & Practices I force myself to learn, because it was suggested by our manager.

<!-- ### On what parameters do you judge a codebase? -->

### What are you working on right now?

This is documented on my [now page](https://bhupesh.me/now/).
