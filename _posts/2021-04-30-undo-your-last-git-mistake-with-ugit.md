So I have been working on this little tool called [**ugit**](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/ugit) (and was finally able to release a stable version), the goal is to make it easier for beginner to intermediate git users to undo their last (accidental) git command.
Because we are not perfect and commit mistakes.

"Oh wait I deleted the _auth-jwt_ branch without merging!! fuck" <br>
_Opens browser_<br>
"How to restore deleted branch"<br>
_Wastes 5 minutes reading the thread,_<br>
_Brain context switch, losses focus_<br>
"Aarrgh, Git sucks"

Failure is a good way to learn something new but how many times are you going to mess up with git, if your ultimate goal is to deliver the new feature in your startup as fast as possible, huh?
Git is great but it's not really good with developer experience (DX).

Yo bhupesh, I can just you know _alias_ this command. Oh cool, good luck remembering that alias after 1 month when you fuck-up again.

If you are in the gang of getting things done, adding **ugit** might be a good choice for you.

Ok enough talking.

## What is `ugit`?

It's just a simple shell script with guided programmatic steps to undo your last git command, powered by [FZF]() built for people who live and work with terminals every day.

## Story behind `ugit`

Part of credits go to [Anthony](https://twitter.com/anthonypjshaw) & [Trey](https://twitter.com/treyhunner) for the idea, I stumbled upon [their tweet](https://twitter.com/anthonypjshaw/status/1377162020554874886?s=20) while lurking on Twitter.
So thanks!

## I don't like your stupid script
