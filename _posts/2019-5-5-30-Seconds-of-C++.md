So if you are looking forward to learn C++ in 2019, I present to you the [**30 Seconds of C++**](http://bhupeshv.me/30-seconds-of-cpp/).
> A collection of STL (_Standard Template Library_) features of C++ which can be learned in 30 seconds or less.

## What is it again? üßê

30 Seconds of C++ (_hereafter referred to as 30C++_) is a collection of modern C++ STL features like algorithms, containers, etc combined into short C++ snippets that can be learned in 30 seconds or less.
Inspired by the [30 Seconds of Code](https://30secondsofcode.org/index)
 
## Why did you make it? üòÆ
I personally find it hard to learn modern C++ (C++ 14,17) through numerous C++  tutorials which either have incomplete info or if you wanna go further you may find yourself browsing these websites for modern C++

- [cplusplus](http://www.cplusplus.com/)
- [cpprefrence](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)

The problem with the above 2 resources is that they sometimes give too much info overshadowing the simple things to understand and from a perspective of a "beginner" who has just started learning that can be frustrating.
Although both these resources are damn good if you have a basic understanding which _30C++_ can give.
 
## Why would I learn C++? üòí

No doubt languages like JavaScript, Python, Java are ruling the programming world currently but the undoubted presence of C++ in the top 10 languages prove that C++ is evergreen and its presence will never diminish.

You can conclude from the above post that C++ is in the Top 3 skills required at Google.

I myself use Python as my main language but over the years C++ has helped me become a better developer, even if you are new to programming, using C++ as your starter language will be a good choice.

Even if you're not learning C++ from Job point of view, it offers a ton of learning experience.

## How will it help me? ü§î
- 30C++ includes all the modern C++ features & more of them are coming day by day.
- It can help you learn modern C++ step by step without browsing through any lousy and confusing documentation.
- Currently, some of the library headers available are : 
  - `<algorithm>`
  - `<list>`
  - `<stack>`
  - `<queue>`
  - `<vector>`

- Also learning modern C++ will surely help if you are seeking a professional career in C++. 
- If you are a CS Student then learning C++ will be surely helpful,        [Why CS students *must* learn C++ as their main programming language](https://medium.com/@vardanator/why-cs-students-must-learn-c-as-their-main-programming-language-6d3b4f8720bd)
- All the Snippets are explained in an easy to understand lucid manner with a link to run the example code.

- As quoted by [Bartlomiej Filipek](https://www.bfilipek.com/p/about.html)
 > _I am not saying that C++ is fantastic and you should abandon everything and just stick to it. If you‚Äôre just starting it‚Äôs good to have more options and learn different things. Even if you‚Äôre a C++ guy already, it‚Äôs vital to learn something new and improve._

## 30 Seconds of Knowledge üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
If you are lazy(like me) you can also learn C++ and experience _30C++_ on your browser by adding [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/30-seconds-of-knowledge/mmgplondnjekobonklacmemikcnhklla?hl=en) awesome web extension to your favorite browser built by [Stefan Petrovic](https://github.com/petrovicstefanrs).
