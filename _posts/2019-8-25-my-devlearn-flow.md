We all learn at our own pace and in ther own way, in this post I "try" to explain what I do to grow and become an efficient dev one step at a time.

> ⚠️ **This flow is a personal flow it may or may not help you.**

*Create*
It all begins from you creating something out of whatever you already know or if you're a complete beginner you may saw some tutorial that is the *"Learn"* stage.

As you can see in the above flow there are 3 phases which you may encounter while beign a programmmer.

# Phase 1 - The Undefined
This is an endless cycle of Create 🔄 Learn, you never stop learning while being a dev.
It's a **Learn** <-> **Implement** cycle, once you learn something new you use that to implement something.
Implementation can be of different perspective for different people, you may solve a hackerrank problem, debug that error, implemet a new feature or write a blog.
This is a never ending phase if you are

# Phase 2 - The Juggler
In phase 2 there are 3 stages :

1. Feedback 
2. Improve
3. Learn

## Feedback
Once you create something one thing you should always do is to ask someone to review it for you, this may help you cross out all doubts you have regarding your project.

You can ask anyone it may be you friend, your project manager, your colleague, your college professor or even a stranger on Reddit.
Another way of getting feedback on your project is to OpenSource it and write a [Blog](https://dev.to/bhupesh/todohub-create-a-todo-list-using-github-issues-2had) about it or maybe launch it on ProductHunt !
I have been following the later approach for a while now and its been rewarding.

## Improve
Once you are successfully able to get feedback your chances of improving increases.
Jot down all the things you thought you could have implemeted in the app or 

> Tip : If you use GitHub for side projects use the "issues" they are very handy for remembering what you had to do or what not. I recently started doing this for even my not so great projects.


# Phase 3 - The Pro Stage
In phase 3 there are 3 stages :

1. Appreciated 
2. Motivated
3. Learn

## Appreciated
I call this the pro stage because, once your stuff start getting liked by the communtiy people start appreceating what you do and how you do it.
this appreciation injects in you the _motivation_ to create & learn more.

> Everyone needs a little appreciation 💟.

## Motivated
The ultiamte goal with every profession is how motivated you are for your work, Programming is no far from this, I constantly see people getting burned out (or procrastinating to hell 😰).
I get motivation from the stuff I create (my blogs usually), after a long time I have started reciving DMs from people telling me how they loved my blog and I love the very thing that someone out there took time to message me personally 💓.
Due to this very thing I may not leave technial blogging forever 😛

> Tip: before you start your day programming make sure you make a small to-do list
<span class="mark"> just before you turn on your PC/laptop </span> and in the list add only the things you would do in that sitting.
For example if you program 2-3 hours constantly make sure your to-do list contains items that can be completed in that time frame, Don't think about tommorrow think about the present.



> This strategy is pretty handy & has been giving me positive results 😃 since I started creating stuff, it may not work on you but you may surley gain some insights from this.
