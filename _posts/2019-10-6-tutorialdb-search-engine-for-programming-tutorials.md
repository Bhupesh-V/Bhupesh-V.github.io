TLDR;
> Hey guys I just launched **[tutorialdb](https://tutorialdb-app.herokuapp.com/)**, it's a small scale search engine for programming tutorials.

## Why did you make that ?
There is no escape from the fact that everyone starts programming after watching a cool programming "tutorial". Tutorials somehow make us who we are today.

The problem is you (as a beginner) may or may not find the perfect tutorial to follow, tutorialdb does the work for you (gathering tutorials) so that you don't waste your time googling.

Another reason for making it was that sometimes tutorials which are hosted on personal blogs do not get indexed easily on google (compared to tutorials hosted for e.g on medium ).

<blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When you are starting, there is no best tutorial.<br><br>Just learn as much as you can from multiple sources.<br><br>You can always connect the dots later looking back.</p>&mdash; JavaScript Teacher (@js_tut) <a href="https://twitter.com/js_tut/status/1176978665374175232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
