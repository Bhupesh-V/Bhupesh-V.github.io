Its time to increase your horsepower and write code faster than before. In this tutorial I will cover how to setup and use code-snippets in Vim or NeoVim for Go, Python, Bash and Markdown (since I deal with them everyday)

Also note that this tutorial is for people who have recently started to use Vim as their main editor, or for people who are looking for reasons to switch to Vim gang (don‚Äôt worry Vim has everything a modern editor can provide & much more!)

## Introduction

Code snippet ecosystem in Vim is segregated into different plugins, here is how it looks like in a generic way

```

                ---------------------
                |  Snippet Provider | [vim-snippets]
                ---------------------
                          | 
                          v
                --------------------
                |  Snippet Manager | [Ultisnips, snipMate]
                --------------------
                          |
                          v
                --------------------
                |  Code Completion | [YCM, deoplete, coc]
                --------------------

```

### Installing Plugins

For this tutorial, we will be installing Ultisnips and vim-snippets.

If you use [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug),

```vim
Plug 'SirVer/ultisnips'
Plug 'honza/vim-snippets'
```

For Vundle,

```vim
Plugin 'SirVer/ultisnips'
Plugin 'honza/vim-snippets'
```

For vanilla vim, run the following commands

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/bundle/start && cd $_
git clone https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips.git
git clone https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets.git
```

_Let me know if the above commands don't work on vanilla vim, I nuked mine üòõÔ∏è_

Once you have installed both the plugins, open your **vimrc** or **init.vim** to configure some key mappings for ultisnips

```vim
let g:UltiSnipsExpandTrigger="<tab>"
" list all snippets for current filetype
let g:UltiSnipsListSnippets="<c-l>"
```

### How to use ultisnips

1. Type the ‚Äúsnippet trigger‚Äù (listed below in the 1st column) and press TAB in insert mode to evaluate the snippet block.
2. Use `Ctrl` + `j` to jump forward within the snippet.
3. Use `Ctrl` + `k` to jump backward within the snippet.
4. Use `Ctrl` + `l` to list all the snippets available for the current file-type

Below are some of the **most common snippets** you should start using right now!

You can also power up note-taking in markdown with some more plugins like [vim-markdown](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown) & [tabular](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular)

## How to create your own snippets

vim-snippets stores its code-snippets in 2 different directories:

- `$HOME/.config/nvim/plugged/vim-snippets/snippets/` snipMate compatible
- `$HOME/.config/nvim/plugged/vim-snippets/UltiSnips/` for people who use vim-snippets with ultisnips (the snippet format is different)

The variable `g:UltiSnipsSnippetDirectories` can be used to specify different locations to look for snippets

```vim
let g:UltiSnipsSnippetDirectories=["UltiSnips", $HOME.'/Documents/.Varshney/snippets/']

```

Creating a snippet is fairly easy, the basic format is as follows

```vim-snippet
snippet <trigger_word> "Description" [options]
# code block
endsnippet

```

> Read more about snippet options in manual `:help UltiSnips-snippet-options`

Below is an example of a Jekyll Post header from my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/.Varshney)

```vim-snippet
snippet head "Jekyll Post Header" b
---
layout: post
comments: true
title: ${1:title}
description: ${2:description}
tags: ${3:tags}
image: ${4:image}
---

$0
endsnippet

```

The part in braces `{1:title}` is called a placeholder. When the snippet is expanded, `Ctrl` + `j` will visually select the next placeholder so that you can change the text. In the same way, `Ctrl` + `k` will visually select the previously entered placeholder

Here is a short demo of how this works
