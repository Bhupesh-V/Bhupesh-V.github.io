Hi there all this is my first post on [dev.to](dev.to) (I love this platform 😍👍).

This is regarding any advice all the *experinced* developers can give me as I have just started my very first internship as a **Backend Developer** at [DyfoLabs](https://dyfolabs.com).

I will be working on problems in home automation and using IoT to solve them.

I would like to thank 😄 all those people who posted a lot of great content on [dev.to](dev.to) regularly .

I have learned so much during these 3,4 months(my presence on *dev*)  through *dev.to* which I guess may have driven me to this opportunity.

Once again thank you all (I wish I could tag all of them ☺️).

Please do share your thoughts.
