title: Checklist for software engineers who think there's no growth without working at scale
description: Challenging the perspective that growing as a software engineering is only possible in large-scale organizations.
---

Some tech-workers aren't _lucky_ enough to end up working for organizations that deal with a gazillion users, there are some hard challenges to solve there, but this career is rarely about putting more server boxes. Software is a complex discipline, dealing with both code & humans. The Internet has painted the idea that there's no growth for a software engineer when there's no scale, thanks to software-scale porn on social media. I wanna challenge that perspective.

## Pre-requisites & Assumptions

At a personal level,

1. You are financially well compensated, and have no intention or need to switch your workplace.
2. You have significant free time at your workplace from a brain-power POV (you have a lot of mental energy that can be spent but isn't).

At an organizational level,

1. You are surrounded by like-minded folks.
2. Leadership is supportive & consistently takes/acts on feedback, or
3. You are NOT surrounded by folks who hinder your growth.

## The Checklist

1. How much time are you spending mentoring folks in your team, so they upskill to a point they become independent? Similarly, how's the knowledge-sharing culture? Have you contributed anything to it?
2. What about improving DX across different pipelines and projects? Those things certainly take a lot of time and effort. Similarly, what things are costing excessive money to management? Try optimizing those flows.
3. What about the most straightforward thing, testing? Are your unit tests really testing anything? What about integration testing? Are you spinning up test containers?
4. How about representing your organization at tech conferences? Share your culture/growth with others. This could be a bit tricky, since some groups may not really accept proposals from small, unknown companies, but assuming you are solving problems, talks like, How `TECH` is changing the `BUSINESS_DOMAIN` are well appreciated as well.
5. What about security, how confidently can you say all applications that you work on are secure? Do you run security audits yourself? What about compliance frameworks?
6. What about skills in cross-functional domains, DevOps, & Infra. Do you use IaaC, what's stopping you from learning it?
7. What about the documentation culture? Are there any contexts that only exist in one team member's head? Even simple 3-tier-based applications easily become complex when combined with cloud tech, data migrations, and database backups, so many things are left untouched.
8. There's no way your team doesn't have tech debt, it starts from the very first commit. How are you dealing with it? Is it a priority? What have you done to resolve those items?
9. What about Product Thinking? Forget about having empathy for users for a moment, but do you know why your product is built? Or why do the clients you work for need something, have you looked at the competitors yourself? From a tech worker's POV, knowing this is about understanding problem statements in real life, which doesn't just help in your engineering career but also helps you grow as a human being.
10. For people in the mid-career/senior stage, do you know how to [assess people in an interview](https://til.bhupesh.me/people/tech-hiring-interesting-finds)? Or is your entire bar still, _can they invert a binary tree under pressure_?

## The mindset

Personally, I am not even halfway through the list. There's nothing wrong with chasing the big bucks, brand, or scale, but that doesn't necessarily mean everyone who doesn't do that is somehow lesser than you. Learn to have respect for your craft.

Assuming the prerequisites are met, the only thing you need to change is [how you think about your work](https://bhupesh.me/humanity-line-of-code/), everything else will follow.

Notice that none of the items I shared are part of _over-engineering_ anything (Automation/Optimizing without need) these are basic expectations from a software engineer in some organizations. I bet you don't have all of them checked out (if you do, I will buy you coffee, [let's chat](https://bhupesh.me/chat/)). There's so much to do even when your server doesn't receive 2M requests per day. Growth can happen wherever humans are evolved.
