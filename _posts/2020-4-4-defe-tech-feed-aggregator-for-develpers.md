TLDR;
> I created defe (devfeed), a WebApp & CLI for aggregating popular "Tech" feeds for developers & Tech Enthusiasts

## Why did I built this ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Well I like reading tech, this involves subscribing to newsletters & listening to various podcasts.
But the only problem with this is that all of this is distributed causing me to waste my time by installing various apps (which I open only once per day) & subscribing to a number of newsletters.

Well of course you have *feedly* but hey its not free right ?
That's why I thought of creating a FOSS alternative which is
- Simple Enough to use (Minimal UI)
- Is available for multiple clients (PWA & CLI for terminal lovers)
- Can show me information while I'm travelling

## Features ‚ú®
- PWA

- Read & Share Stories
- Dark Mode *

Is that it ?
No
**defe is a package**, so you can make Bots ü§ñ using it.

```python
from defe import defe
import pprint

f = defe.feed()

pprint.pprint(f.news())

```
This will print all the News from available News Feeders. You can read the [documentation](https://defe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on how to use the package.

## How its built ü§î

The architecture is fairly simple

An Overview of how defe works

</figure>

Multiple feeders are fetched at the same time using [`ThreadPoolExecutor()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor) & are kept in a cache.

> Feeders are web-sources which have a public feed (RSS/Atom) link
You can have a look at all the feeders [here](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/defe/tree/master/core/feeders).

Let's say you request `/news` or run `defe news` (on CLI) all the available feeders under _News_ category would be fetched simultaneously and are pushed in a [_disk based cache_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)#Disk_cache), subsequent requests will come from this cache.
For now the cache expiry time-limit is set to 1 hr by default (future releases might have a option to clear cache manually)

I used the following stack to build defe
- Python
- JavaScript

Few pre-built libraries/components which helped me build defe
- [MaterialzeCSS](https://materializecss.com/)
For the front-end of WebApp
- [feedparser](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser)
For parsing RSS/Atom feeds of web sources.
- [diskcache](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/diskcache/)
Used for temporarily storing feeds for faster access.


## How it looks :fire:

Here is a demo for the defe CLI

And the WebApp Looks like

I still have a lot of ideas to improve defe, but not all of it I can do alone, I require your help :heart:

## Future Visions üëê
Some of the things I wish to implement in future

- Push Notifications
- Bookmark Stories
- Play Podcasts right in terminal (for defe CLI)
- Custom Feeds
