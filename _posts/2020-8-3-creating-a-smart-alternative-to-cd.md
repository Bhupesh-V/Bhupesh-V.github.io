title: Creating a smart alternative to 'cd' command
description: Shell function to automatically find absolute paths and change directories

Do you sometimes forget the actual location of directories & have to juggle through `cd` & `ls` to know the right path?
In this short post, we discuss how to make a "smart" alternative to `cd` command on Linux (& probably MacOS ðŸ™„).

The problem is simple we just need to automate this task of finding the actual location of directories and the 2 most popular commands to do that are `find` & `locate`:

## 1. `locate`

- Used to search for files, much faster than `find`.
- Limited functionality.
- Depends on external database for fast finding (`/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db`).
```bash
# search file paths which exactly match the pattern, "memes"
locate -r '/memes$' | grep $HOME
```

## 2. `find`

- Extensive options.
- Can search for both files & directories.
- Slower than `locate`.
```bash
# search for directory "memes" inside your home dir.
find -O2 $HOME -name "memes" -type d
```

Ok then basics clear, now we write a small `bash` function to create `scd` (smart `cd`).

```bash

scd() {
    if [[ $1 != "" ]]; then
        while read -r value; do
            if [[ -d $value ]]; then
                printf "%s\n" "Hit ðŸŽ¯: $value"
                cd "$value"
            fi
        done < <( locate -e -r "/$1$" | grep "$HOME" )
    else
        cd "$HOME" || exit
    fi
}

```

That's it, 12 liner (a little) better alternative to cd.
Now you can add it to your `.bashrc` or better create a <a href="https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/.Varshney/blob/master/.bash_functions"><span class="mark">.bash_functions</span></a> file and source it in your default shell config.

```bash
if [ -f ~/.bash_functions ]; then
    . ~/.bash_functions
fi
```

> Note: If you are on Mac, `locate` would probably be not available, use `find` instead.

Not yet convinced?
Ok, a more advance version with options like `..`, `-`

```bash
scd() {
    if [[ $1 != "" ]]; then
        case $1 in
            [".."]* ) cd .. ;;
            ["-"]* ) cd - ;;
            ["/"]* ) cd / ;;
            * ) while read -r value; do
                    if [[ -d $value ]]; then
                        printf "%s\n" "Hit ðŸŽ¯: $value"
                        cd "$value"
                    fi
                done < <( locate -e -r "/$1$" | grep "$HOME" ) ;;
        esac
    else
        cd "$HOME" || exit
    fi
}
```

### Cons ðŸ˜¤

- ~~Well, one of the problems with our bash function is that we wouldn't be able to leverage "tab" auto-suggestions.~~. [Read More](#tab-auto-suggestions)
- Newly created directories won't be readily available with the `locate` command as it depends on its own database `mlocate.db`. The database is updated automatically by our system through a cron job. Although you can still do it manually.
```bash
sudo updatedb
```

### Pros ðŸ“ˆ

- Don't have to search for directory paths & cd into it.
- Even if `scd` switches to the wrong directory (in case of multiple matches), you will still be able to see what's the actual path in output & then switch to it manually.

what do you think?

### The `CDPATH`

Thanks to Santosh's comment on my [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6696322663343910912/) there is another way of switching directories "smartly".

`CDPATH` can be used as a search path for the cd command. A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for destination directories specified by the cd command.

It gives you a limited functionality to cd into sub-directories of a specific parent directory.

For e.g in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` add this line.

```bash
export CDPATH=".:/home/bhupesh/Desktop"
```

And now you can freely switch directories inside Desktop & would not have to use `cd ~/Desktop/dirB` or `cd /home/username/Desktop/dirB`.
Well of-course now you need to do this manually & find out which directories you usually spent more time in.

### <kbd>Tab</kbd> Auto-suggestions

Thanks to Thamara's [comment](http://disq.us/p/2b3uzqy), I recently added "tab" suggestions powered by [bash_completions](https://iridakos.com/programming/2018/03/01/bash-programmable-completion-tutorial).

<img title="scd : switch directories from anywhere to anywhere" alt="scd demo gif" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34342551/90309212-1eee0500-df04-11ea-9695-490103823164.gif">


**How to use ?**

1. Start a new bash session.
2. Source the completions script `source scd-completions.bash`. Get it [from here](https://gist.github.com/Bhupesh-V/a6854ea193b0fce7a57d85ef0d133340).
3. Create a new version of `scd` function :
    ```bash
    scd() {
        if [ -z "$1" ]; then
            echo "No directory path provided"
            exit 2
        else
            echo "$1"
            cd "$1" || exit
        fi
    }
    ```
3. Create a `.inputrc` file in your HOME directory with following options enabled. [Read More](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Commands-For-Completion.html#Commands-For-Completion) about these options.

    ```bash
    set show-all-if-ambiguous on
    set completion-ignore-case on
    set completion-map-case on
    set show-all-if-unmodified on
    set menu-complete-display-prefix on
    "\t": menu-complete% 
    ```

4. scd `<search-string>[TAB][TAB]`

Pressing [TAB] one time triggers the completion. Pressing it twice will automatically complete the command.
