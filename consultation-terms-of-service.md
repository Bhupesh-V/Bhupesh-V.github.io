# Consultation Terms of Service

This document outlines the terms of service for any consultation sessions that I offer. By [booking a session](/hire) with me, you agree to these terms.

## General

1. All consultation sessions will be conducted over a video call. I will not provide any in-person consultation.
2. I will help you with anything within my expertise in a form that may be valuable to you i.e. advice, opinions, feedback, etc.
3. I will keep the details of our discussion private indefinitely. However, you should be careful **not to** disclose any confidential details during our session. I will not sign an NDA.
4. You can record the session if you would like to rewatch it. However, you cannot post the recording publicly and must ask for my consent if you need to use it for other purposes.
5. I will not be held responsible for any damages/liabilities/losses that may result from my suggestions, feedback, or anything else we discuss.
6. Free & paid consultations on [`Domain C`](https://bhupesh.me/hire/#domain-c-as-a-dev-community-buildermanager), i.e., my help as a Dev Community Builder/Manager, no questions or conversations related to the moderation of [r/developersIndia](https://reddit.com/r/developersIndia) will be entertained.

## Free Sessions

1. I reserve the right to cancel or reschedule the session at any time.
2. I will not create any deliverables or provide any follow-up support.
3. Free consultation sessions are only limited to one-time booking per person (or entity).
