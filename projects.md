Some of my significant projects, tools & scripts

## Legends never die

Projects that I comeback to from time to time, unless of-course I don't have to.

- [**ugit**](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/ugit) - ugit helps you undo git commands.

## Burdened with glorious purpose

These projects served their purpose, some of them still work.

1. [**zoe**](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/zoe)
   - A barebones transactional in-memory key: value store with an interactive prompt.
   - This was built as part of writing a tutorial on solving a [interview question](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/design-a-key-value-store-in-go/).
2. [**git-feed**](https://til.bhupesh.me/shell/generate-feed-files-in-git-repo) (script)
   - Generate a RSS Feed of recent files inside a Git repository.
   - This has a very niche use-case, but it will still work. I use a JSON feed for my [digital garden](https://til.bhupesh.me).
3. [**git-prs**](https://bhupesh.me/finding-pull-requests-that-change-a-file-terminal/) (script)
   - Find pull requests that modify a file path in the terminal.
   - Yeah, I don't know if its useful to anyone.
4. [**surf**](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/.Varshney/blob/master/scripts/surf) (script)
   - A standalone script to surf web (Powered by searx).
   - I no longer browse internet using terminal. Might come back to it again in future.
5. [**memer-action**](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/memer-action)
   - A GitHub Action for Programmer Memes xD.
   - I still use it, check my github profile for some memes.
6. [**AreYouOk**](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/areyouok)
   - A fast and easy to use URL health checker ‚õëÔ∏è  Keep your links healthy during tough times.
   - It works, there's not much maintenance required.
7. [**bkp**](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/.Varshney/blob/master/scripts/bkp) (script)
   - Script to backup files as a GitHub Gist with 0 dependencies.
   - Nothing much to it, but it works.
8. [**defe**](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/defe)
   - A tech feed aggregator for Developers & Tech Enthusiasts.
   - One of my major web-based projects, it was fun to work on. This still works but I haven't managed to give any time to host it somewhere.
9. [**dotman**](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/dotman)
   - dotman is a simple, elegant & easy to use dotfiles manager üññüèΩ
   - I no longer actively maintain my dotfiles, hence my inactivity.

## So long, partner

Projects that I no longer maintain but might be useful to someone.

1. [**30 Seconds of C++**](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/30-seconds-of-cpp)
   - A knowledge base of learning C++ via 30 second snippets.
   - Still one of my most starred repositories, unfortunately I don't work with C++ professionally anymore.
2. [**PlagCheck**](https://codeclassroom.github.io/PlagCheck/)
   - [Moss](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) Results wrapper with powerful insights & analysis üí°.
   - The goal of this project was to identify [who copied code from whom](https://plagcheck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/insights/) in a class.
   - It was built as part of a [larger system](https://github.com/codeclassroom/codeclassroom) for my college major project which was about handling coding assignments via a web platform (think hackerrank but for college coding assignments).
   - Unfortunately, I am no longer in college, hence no motivation to maintain it.
3. [**tutorialdb**](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/tutorialdb)
   - tutorialdb is a small scale search engine for programming/dev tutorials, it is meant to help anyone who is getting started to learn a new technology.
   - Again one of my major web-based projects, it was more of a moderated collection of dev resources, with a automatic tagging system.
4. [**myosc**](https://github.com/developersIndia/myosc)
   - A github action to list your opensource contributions in a README.
5. [**contributors**](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/.Varshney/blob/master/scripts/contributors) (script)
   - Find total contributors on all repositories of a github user.
