## Trying to level up

- At the moment I have around 2+ YoE as a software professional, the transition from this mid-level position to a senior is a bit hard, but I'm trying to get there.
- 2 key things I am trying to figure out:
  - Working with large scale systems, i.e. products/projects with a large user base. Not sure if that even matters in the grand scheme of things.
  - How to lead larger projects. As in taking _more_ responsibilites & ownership.
- Programming stack wise, I have worked majorly with Go, with a touch of Dart (Flutter) & Python for few months or short term work projects. I guess I will stick with Go for a while but the next item on my list is most definitely Elixir.

## Working on personal projects

- Recently started a new project called [shedock](https://github.com/shedock/shedock), it's an experimental tool to dockerize shell scripts. Doing this exercise to learn more about the container and shell ecosystems.

## Trying to lead efforts as a volunteer

- I have been with [r/developersIndia](https://reddit.com/r/developersIndia) since its inception in 2020 as a volunteer, acting as a lead. So struggling with the responsibilities and trying to make it better.
- This includes moderating the community, organizing events, potentially evangelizing about it.
