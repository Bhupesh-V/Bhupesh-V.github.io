## Main focus

- Getting back into the physical world. My living comes from being in the digital one, and I’m a bit tired of the stark difference between them. As a result, I’ve started journaling, got myself a pocket diary, and some Uni-ball pens.
- Learning about Systems Thinking.

## On the back burner

- Planning to get into Single Board Computers, get my first Raspberry Pi and hoping to run few of my projects on it.
- Figure out actional goals to transition from a mid-level software engineer position to a senior. I believe its going to take a lot of years to get there. Plus the sad state of affairs in this industry just pisses me off.
- Passively helping r/developersIndia with admin/moderation responsibilities (2-4 hours a week).
- Go back into adding more cool stuff on [**osscooking.com**](https://osscooking.com/).
