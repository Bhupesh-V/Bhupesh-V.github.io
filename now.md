## Main focus

- Getting back into the physical world. My living comes from being in the digital one, and I’m a bit tired of the stark difference between them. As a result, I’ve started journaling, got myself a pocket diary, and some Uni-ball pens.
- Learning about systems thinking.

## On the back burner

- Planning to get into Single Board Computers, get my first Raspberry Pi and hoping to run few of my projects on it.
- Go back into adding more cool stuff on [**osscooking.com**](https://osscooking.com/).
- Figure out actional goals to transition from a mid-level software engineer position to a senior. I believe its going to take a lot of years to get there. Plus the sad state of affairs in this industry just pisses me off.

<!-- ## Trying to lead efforts as a community lead

- I have been with [r/developersIndia](https://reddit.com/r/developersIndia) since its inception in 2020 as a volunteer. So struggling with the responsibilities and trying to make the community experience better. It's a self-appointed role. Some of the major stuff I take care of:
  - Organizing AMAs & Weekly Discussions.
  - Helping the forum moderation team.
  - Taking care of the job board, wiki & other open-source projects.
  - Building up the volunteer team. -->

<!-- ## Currently reading

- I have a dedicated digital bookshelf, head over to [bookshelf.bhupesh.me](https://bookshelf.bhupesh.me/) to see what I am reading at the moment. -->
