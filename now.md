## Trying to level up

- At the moment I have around 3+ YoE as a professional software engineer, the transition from this mid-level position to a senior is a bit hard, but I'm trying to get there. Frankly, I believe its going to take a lot of years to get there.
- 2 key things I am trying to figure out:
  - Working with large scale systems, i.e. products/projects with a large user base. Not sure if that even matters in the grand scheme of things.
  - How to lead larger projects. As in taking _more_ responsibilites & ownership.
- Programming stack wise, I have worked majorly with Go, with a touch of Dart (Flutter) & Python for few months or short term work projects. I guess I will stick with Go for a while but the next item on my list is definitely Elixir.

## Working on personal projects

- Started a minimalistic web based tool, [**osscooking.com**](https://osscooking.com/) to analyze what's happening in open-source projects as a busy dev with just 10 minutes to spare.

## Trying to lead efforts as a community lead

- I have been with [r/developersIndia](https://reddit.com/r/developersIndia) since its inception in 2020 as a volunteer. So struggling with the responsibilities and trying to make the community experience better. It's a self-appointed role. Some of the major stuff I take care of:
  - Organizing AMAs & Weekly Discussions.
  - Helping the forum moderation team.
  - Taking care of the job board, wiki & other open-source projects.
  - Building up the volunteer team.

## Currently reading

I have a dedicated digital bookshelf, head over to [bookshelf.bhupesh.me](https://bookshelf.bhupesh.me/) to see what I am reading at the moment.
