<h1 align="center">Hi üëã</h1>

I am Bhupesh Varshney, Developer & FOSS Enthusiast & Creator living in New Delhi, India. I like to build & create stuff using Python, Go, Flutter & Bash. Professionally I have around 19 months of experience in Product-Based Startups. I happen to be Community Manager for [**r/developersIndia**](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/), a community of more than 100K software & tech folks across India.

I make Web, Tools and Open-Source & frequently write about tech & my journey here. You can find more of my content on  [**dev.to**](https://dev.to/bhupesh) and [**freeCodeCamp**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/bhupesh/).

I use [**twitter**](https://twitter.com/bhupeshimself) mostly to rant about tech, share & learn what others are doing.
