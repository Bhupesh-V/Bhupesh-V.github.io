<h1 align="center">Hi üëã</h1>

I am Bhupesh Varshney, a Software Craftsman & Tech Writer living in New Delhi, India. Professionally I more than 2 years of experience in product-based startups. In my free time I volunteer as a Community Lead for [**r/developersIndia**](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/), a community of more than 400K software & tech folks across India.

I frequently write about tech & my journey here. You can find more of my work on my [**hire page**](/hire). If you are interested in things I have built, head over to my [**projects page**](/projects).

I use [**X (formerly twitter)**](https://twitter.com/bhupeshimself) mostly to rant about tech, share & learn what others are doing.
